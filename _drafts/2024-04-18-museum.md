While you’re young visit the museum,\
for it is free! Huzzah! Run around,\
Hours turn into minutes as you peer\
you stare effortlessly into the Vermeer,\
ignoring the text on the side. This is art.

When you get older, your knees will\
have trouble going up the stairs. But now?\
Use an elevator. Even your body cannot betray\
the lingering impression of the Monet\
on the train ride home. You’re smiling.

But when you get to the station,\
Look around and you’ll see the woman\
She’s holding a parasol. On the way home,\
you stare through a window. He’s reading\
a letter. You step on a snake,\
and snow begins to fall down.

It’s always free.
