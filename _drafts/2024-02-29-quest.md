out in the middle of nowhere,\
the small questers begin to start.\
they walk softly, like little sheep.

softness & moistness in the air,\
made every new day feel like art,\
out in the middle of nowhere.

every morning they would take heart,\
remembering the hidden and lovely daycare,\
they walk softly, like little sheep.

they could recite mantra by heart,\
one must always respect the sheep!\
out in the middle of nowhere.

after their late quest, a fresh start\
this experience they all share\
they walk softly, like little sheep.

there comes a day when they departâ€“\
bring intention with you somewhere.\
out to the middle of nowhere,\
they walk softly, like little sheep.
