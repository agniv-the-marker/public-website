The man sat down at his typewriter\
and he began to type.\
His long fingers [0]\
Carefully caressed [1] each key till it\
Loudly [3] clicked it’s way to\
Entering the dark [2] page.

The door creaked open and the\
man cre-tur-uh [???]\
[Checking the bits]\
[0132*#@&#&...23…]

The woman entered the ro\
kit-cham-bed-\
[My transcripts are off.]\
[Why would a woman enter blank space?]

[Perhaps the man knew,]\
[that this state of being,]\
[was only his at the moment.]\
[For forever.]

## Idea and Feelings

This was inspired by the [No-Cloning Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem) which I find to be pretty cool. It maybe points at abstract reasoning but I'm unsure how I feel about it yet.
