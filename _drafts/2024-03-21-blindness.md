Do you know what liminal means?\
It’s when you go on a walk,

And you spend a while,\
(It feels scary sometimes)

Before you ever reach somewhere.\
Make sure to look up now and then.

Spiderman told me too.\
Sometimes I look up and see him,

Saving my city.\
I don’t think anyone can wear the mask.

But we must look up from the ground.\
To not see Icarus fall down,

But to see that he also flew,\
A defiance of his small stature.

Marvel in our small stature,\
and adore how large we feel,

among the metallic trees\
upon which we swing.
