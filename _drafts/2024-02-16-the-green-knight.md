who remembers when he cut off his head!\
slayed it all but the green hue of temptation,\
the man is now great,\
his lover in shambles.\
one year hence? for what is a year,\
but one of the great springs,\
unto one fewer summer,\
preparing us all for his fall.

a great man went to become good,\
faced with perilous evils. its just as\
whenever you wake up in the morn,\
and try to live without getting all torn.\
both you and him may hallucinate death—\
does it always stop before the ending?

she may awake you suddenly,\
and do as she asks,\
for she just needs her head,\
be she a spirit in the mist,\
or the girl of your dreams.\
maybe you’ll find your own.

find a companion,\
be it a fox,\
a hug,\
but never as simple as a stroke,\
or a kiss.\
for the fox will warn you,\
a hug will hold you back.\
gawain, the girdle is useless!

everyone remembers the line,\
“now, off with your head!”\
it doesn’t seem that great to be the head,\
but what does it mean to be great?\
only him and the knight know,\
for we all need to hear the words,\
“well done,\
my brave knight.”
