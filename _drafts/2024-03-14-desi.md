## hanuman

king of demon’s bane\
anjana born, this vanara\
legends of this monkey of a man\
all to put me to sleep as a child.

bandar’s quiet din hosting the protector\
always calm, the learned yogi.\
never so big to lack humility; never to small to turn away\
death evades him, the chiranjivi\
akshahantre’s form is simply divine.\
resounding the chant, oṁ śrī hanumate namaḥ

## ganesha

prancing around the kingdom\
india’s stomper of obstacles,\
long tusks and trunk flail about\
lambodara laughs aloud as he gazes\
all his might atop his tiny vahana\
i carefully spot mūṣaka\
you may find this amusing, this grāma-devatā\
rather, the two are more alike than not, the vigneshvaras

## kali

please be wary\
around kaushiki, for when she’s mad—\
raktabija’s blood had never tasted so sweet.\
vama kali’s skin so dark, the niguna descends\
all Shiva can do is lay,\
to cushion the earth from her ghungroos clanging.\
i fall asleep, knowing i am hidden from her gaze.

## Fixing

I think these are more playing with the epithets more than anything.
