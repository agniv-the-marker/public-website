convention break we must\
yet begin we when lust\
more something than for trust\
it’s all a bust!

Anyway,\

Drop out! Leave! Pack your bags and,\
These ladders are tall and\
swinging upon them is fun, and\
oh no. This is band.

You’ve lost your way on this dirty and unforgiving road. It’s your first time, but it is your only time.\

Or is it?\
The world is unforgiving yet large\
and forgetful, so it is kind.

You’re a long way from home. You climbed a ladder and fell far from home, and now you struggle in this Platonian Cave.

Stay calm and carry on.

## Fixing

This is kind of a mess of words more than anything.
