title: Lost at Sea

walk the levels, fear at my feet\
guests ate the food i could not eat\
and round and round and round we flew\
and to my woman and her crew\
yet to object, one weary eye\
the wandering moon, up in the sky

i looked upon the slimy sea.\
the ugly white waves, wild and free\
as we stumbled, lost in a trance\
caught in whirlwind’s mystic dance,\
i tumbled down into the brine\
enveloped by ocean’s wine

the waves sighed with soft secrets\
my legends in waving seagrasses\
the wedding guests now far behind\
their voices bubbling within my mind\
closing my eyes in ocean’s hue\
my eyes gazing beneath the blue

the waves, they beat and beat and beat\
my mind itself went to retreat\
my salty tears, the ocean’s cries\
echoing whispers, questioning why\
this navy jail, my silent plea\
a ship of dreams to set me free\
yet current gripped, unyielding, tight—\
it mocking my desperate plight

i sought refuge in depths alone\
saw no sunken secrets which shone\
a deep cacophonic affair\
of all those saying please beware\
aquatic ballet, the lead part\
a castaway in ocean’s art\
further in the depths, where dark weaved\
my requiem, ocean conceived

so who was i, lost in this sea\
fragment of who i used to be\
the water embraced me with cold\
my soul’s story barely told\
drifting in and out of the deep\
surrender to eternal sleep.
