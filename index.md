I'm Agniv, currently a student of mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and Chinese. In my free time, I fence competitively and try my hand at drawing. I don't necessarily "want to learn everything," but I wouldn't hate if that happened.

I love sunsets, long runs, and bonfires with friends. My favorite comic is still Calvin & Hobbes.
